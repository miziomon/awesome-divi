## Layout

* [Footer layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-footer-layout-pack-10-unique-footer-designs-to-give-your-site-a-leg-up) - Designing a great footer is more challenging than it may seem. That’s why having an attractive starting point is such a valuable resource. The footer designs in this layout pack are highly versatile and can be used as they are or with minor design tweaks for many, if not most, websites.
* [Header layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-download-the-divi-header-ui-kit) - We’ve created a kit that includes ten different headers made from Divi Builder sections.
* [Profile pages layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-download-the-profile-pages-layout-pack) - The Profile Page Layout Pack is perfect for personal landing pages within a larger site or even for micro “about me” websites. Just install the layout pack, take your pick from the styles below, or mix and match to come up with something all your own.
* [Blog post layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-blog-post-layout-pack-will-take-your-builder-powered-articles-to-the-next-level) - In this layout pack we’ve created three gorgeous article layouts that you can use as guides and templates for your own unique Divi Builder powered blog posts.
* [Feature list layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-feature-list-layout-pack-will-help-you-showcase-what-you-have-to-offer-in-style) - Anyone selling a product or service on their website can get serious mileage out of a good feature list. These lists cut straight to the point by showcasing the “features and benefits” associated with your product or service. Designing a visually appealing feature list will contribute to how enticing your offer is to potential customers.
* [Single page layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/download-our-free-divi-layout-pack-for-modern-homepages-and-single-page-websites) - This layout pack includes three unique homepage designs. Each has been built using a cohesive style, customized using the Divi Builder’s advanced design settings and custom CSS to create a truly unique appearance. Each homepage variation was built to serve a different niche, although each includes basic elements that might be useful in just about any type of site. 
* [Testimonials layout kit](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-testimonials-layout-kit) - In today’s world of online reviews no one seems to buy anything without first hearing what past customers have to say about it. That’s why testimonials are so powerful. They’re some of the most effective social proof you can provide for your product or service.
* [Gallery Layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-photo-gallery-layout-pack-5-stunning-gallery-page-layouts-in-one-convenient-download) - Divi provides users with a myriad of ways to display their images. Whether that’s as full screen backgrounds, fullwidth sections, within a slider, a gallery, or as individual images on a page/post. But getting the right combination of elements–the right balance that results in a compelling page design–can be difficult for anyone. That’s why in today’s post we’re giving away a new Divi layout pack specifically created to help you create stunning full page galleries with your Divi website.
* [Contact pages layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/download-the-free-divi-contact-pages-layout-pack) - Contact pages are easy to get lazy on. Everyone has them and yet not everyone gives them the design love and attention they deserve. This layout pack will help you jumpstart an above average contact page on any Divi website.

## Performance

* [How to Optimize the Divi Gallery Module](http://www.ibenic.com/optimize-divi-gallery-module/) - Divi theme is a great theme for people who aren’t tech-savvy. The Divi Gallery Module is a module where you can create galleries with a slideshow effect. If you have many images in one or more galleries on a page, that page will have a lot of images that load without being seen


## Resource

* [Mega Menu](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/mega-menus/) - Mega menus allow users to see more links all at once without the hassle of scrolling, hovering, and remembering the contents of your menu. A good way to think about Mega Menus is that they are drop down menus within drop down menus. So instead of your normal dropdown menu which shows a submenu when hovering over your main parent links in your navigation bar, a megamenu allows you to have additional parent links and submenus within the dropdown menu.
* [Divi Tutorials](https://quiroz.co/) - The ultimate library of Divi Tutorials, Layouts, Tips and Tricks for the Web Designer, CSS Enthusiast, and the Digital Entrepreneur in all of us.
