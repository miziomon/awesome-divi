* [Testimonials layout kit](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-testimonials-layout-kit) - In today’s world of online reviews no one seems to buy anything without first hearing what past customers have to say about it.

* [Gallery Layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/free-divi-photo-gallery-layout-pack-5-stunning-gallery-page-layouts-in-one-convenient-download) - Divi provides users with a myriad of ways to display their images. Whether that’s as full screen backgrounds, fullwidth sections, within a slider, a gallery, or as individual images on a page/post. But getting the right combination of elements–the right balance that results in a compelling page design–can be difficult for anyone. That’s why in today’s post we’re giving away a new Divi layout pack specifically created to help you create stunning full page galleries with your Divi website.
* [Contact pages layout pack](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/divi-resources/download-the-free-divi-contact-pages-layout-pack) - Contact pages are easy to get lazy on.

## Performance

* [How to Optimize the Divi Gallery Module](http://www.ibenic.com/optimize-divi-gallery-module/) - Divi theme is a great theme for people who aren’t tech-savvy. The Divi Gallery Module is a module where you can create galleries with a slideshow effect. If you have many images in one or more galleries on a page, that page will have a lot of images that load without being seen


## Resource

* [Mega Menu](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/mega-menus/) - Mega menus allow users to see more links all at once without the hassle of scrolling, hovering, and remembering the contents of your menu. A good way to think about Mega Menus is that they are drop down menus within drop down menus. So instead of your normal dropdown menu which shows a submenu when hovering over your main parent links in your navigation bar, a megamenu allows you to have additional parent links and submenus within the dropdown menu.
